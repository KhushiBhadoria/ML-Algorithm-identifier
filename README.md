**Part_1:Data pre-processing:**
         Data preprocessing is a technique which is used to transform the raw data in a useful and efficient format.It includes data cleaning which improves the quality of data.It replaces the missing values and garbage with the mean or meadian,according to user's choice.It also includes data scaling and partitioning of data.It is done in such a way that works for every classification and regression based dataset.
