Finding the most appropriate algorithm for a particular dataset is also one of the challenges.This project deals with such type of problems and also with the methods through which the performance of ML models can be improved.
**The project aim is to analyze some Machine Learning Algorithms and provide the best algorithm suitable for particular data based on some popular hyperparameters.**

First data pre-processing is done in such a way that works for every classification and regression based dataset.
