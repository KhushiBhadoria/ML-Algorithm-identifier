**Part_1:Data pre-processing:**
         Data preprocessing is a technique which is used to transform the raw data in a useful and efficient format.It includes data cleaning which will improve the quality of data.It will replace the missing values and garbage with the mean or median,according to user's choice.It also includes data scaling and partitioning of data.It is done in such a way that it works for every classification and regression based dataset.

**Part_2:Tuning of Hyperparameters:**
         Tuning of Hypermeters increases the overall efficiency of the model.In this project,the value of K(neighbors) in KNN is 7. The number of K-folds used is used as 5 for each algorithm.In Random Forest,100 estimators is taken.RBF kernel is taken into consideration in SVR.
         
**Part_3:ML Algorithms:**
        Here I have applied Linear Regression,KNN,Random Forest and SVR.K-folds are also applied to each algorithm to check whether the accuracy of the model is increasing or decreasing.
        
**Part_4:Data visualization:**
        Data visualization provides an important suite of tools for identifying a qualitative understanding. This can be helpful when we try to explore the dataset and extract some information to know about a dataset and can help with identifying patterns.
        The best fitted algorithm is chosen on the basis of Graphical Representation.The best fit model for any dataset is the algorithm that has the least root mean squared error(RMSE) and greatest accuracy.
